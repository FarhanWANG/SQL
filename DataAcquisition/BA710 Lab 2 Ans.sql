1. 1. Create row numbers and a first order field for each country.  Include ShipCountry, CustomerID, 
OrderID, and OrderDate.  Your output should also contain a field for the earliest 
order for each country.  Your output should also contain a row number for each 
record within a country.  (e.g., France should start at 1 and count up; Belgium 
should then start at 1 and count up.)
